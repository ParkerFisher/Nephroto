# Nephroto
This is the repository with all of the work done for our Senior Design Capstone Project - Nephroto

Nephroto: Kidney Modeling App is a project that aims to combine the convenience of accessibility from mobile applications and the details of visualization from 3D printed organs: our group has designed a mobile application that rendered a 3D model of an organ from pictures for use by transplant surgeons while awaiting the arrival of the actual organ. Our proposed solution is the only one of its kind tackling this use case. We combine existing technologies that already exist in the market: mobile 3D scanners for Android devices and 3D printed replicas of organs. What distinguishes Nephroto from 3D printed replicas of organs is the application’s potential of cutting down the overhead time in preoperative planning; existing journals note their production of personalized renal models using 3D-printing methods are used in academic settings, providing an effective education program for medical students. Nephroto, on the other hand, was developed to be used outside of the classroom and focuses on modeling kidneys that will be used in operation.


NOTICE! Github does not allow me to upload a file bigger than 25mb, I was able to get most of the files, however the mobile 3D Model viewer application that we used for our project is too big to upload. I will provide the link below, and in order to get models to show up, they must be put inside of the folder labeled "models" within the 3D Modeling Application files. I will also be sending a completed version via google drive.
